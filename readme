Question Set: PHP OOP Practice

1. Class and Method Basics
   Create a class named Person that includes:
   A property: name
   A method: sayHello() that prints "Hello, my name is [name]"

2. Constructor and Method Implementation
   Create a class named Laptop that includes:

Constructor parameters: brand and model

A method: getDetails() that returns the brand and model of the laptop

3. Inheritance and Method Overriding
   Create a parent class named Vehicle with:

A method: start() that prints "vehicle"

Then create a child class named Bike that:

Overrides the start() method to print "bike"

4. Extending Parent Class
   Enhance the Vehicle class by adding one more method of your choice
   (e.g., stop(), displayInfo(), etc.)
   Demonstrate how this new method can also be used in the child class Bike.

5. Interface and Polymorphism
   Define an Animal interface with a method:

makeSound()

Then create two classes Dog and Cat that implement the Animal interface.
Each class should implement the makeSound() method as follows:

Dog ‚Üí prints "Bark"

Cat ‚Üí prints "Meow"

6. Area Calculation Using OOP
   Create a class Circle with:

Constructor that accepts the radius

A method CalculateArea() that returns the area of the circle using the formula:

# Area

ùúã√óùëü^2
Area=œÄ√ór^2

7. Define an interface Degree with a method convertToFahrenheit(), then create a class Temperature that implements the interface, has a private celsius property, initializes it via constructor, implements the conversion using F = (C √ó 9/5) + 32, and display the Fahrenheit value by creating an object with 25¬∞C.
